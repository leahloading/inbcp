After some basic [impact mapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP6KqVuo9Jk&ab_channel=TheAgileBroadcast) I decided the primary features of the application are:

- Podcast feed to display and listen to episodes
- Podcast creator bios

## Prioritising features

Playing episodes directly on the page isn't necessarily the defining feature of this app. Most people will still prefer to discover and listen to podcasts on their application of choice, Apple podcasts, Spotify etc.
However getting an overview of episode content would be great to introduce the brand tone, and fairly straightforward to implement.
