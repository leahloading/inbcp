Iâ€™m using the podcast [rss-feed](https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/403111.rss) to get the episode data into my application, in combination with the [rss-to-json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss-to-json) package. This package allows me to transform the data into a format I can work with.

A single episode has this data structure
