## The Concept

I wanted to build a custom podcast application to display and listen to episodes of the show: It's Not A Book Club Podcast. 

The primary goals was to increase opportunites to collaborate / monetise the podcast by **centralising podcast content and establishing the creator brand**.

## Article 

I wrote an article documenting part of the process of building this application.

<h2>Technologies</h2>

This app was built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS / UI.

It was partially inspired by [Transmit](https://transmit.tailwindui.com/), a podcast application built by the creators of Tailwind CSS.
